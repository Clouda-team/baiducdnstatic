# dojox

**dojox** is a meta-package of other packages that was historically a development area for the Dojo Toolkit.  It
contains packages that run the gamut of JavaScript technology.  Over the years the modules and sub-packages have taken 
dramatically different paths.  Some of the code is very mature, some of the code is experimental and some of the code is
essentially abandoned.  All of the packages require the Dojo Toolkit [core][] and some require the widget library
[dijit][].

You should read the ``README`` file contained in each sub-package to understand the status of the code contained
within.

DojoX is currently not accepting any new sub-packages or projects.  There are many community packages available at
[Dojo Foundation Packages][] and additional packages can be registered there as well.  If you are interested in adding
to the community of packages, please discuss in the [Community Forum][].
